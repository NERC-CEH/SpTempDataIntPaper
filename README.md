# Spatio-Temporal Data Integration in R-INLA Paper

This repository contains the paper draft (complete with all code chunks) for the paper "Spatio-temporal data integration with R-INLA". The main manuscript is available, as is the appendix. It includes an explanation of the method and two case studies, the first combining UKBMS and BTO data on the distribution of the Gatekeeper butterfly across the UK and the second combining EA and ARMI data on the population of the caddisfly in the River Thames catchment area. 

The UKBMS data is publicly available from the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre © copyright and database right Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee ([site locations](https://doi.org/10.5285/8a41e1c8-3018-44f1-8d0a-c1b1ad957fc9), [site indices](https://doi.org/10.5285/180a1c76-bceb-4264-872b-deddfe67b3de)). The BTO data was provided by the British Trust for Ornithology, accessed through NBN Atlas website (CC-BY-NC), for more information see [here](https://registry.nbnatlas.org/public/show/dr529).
